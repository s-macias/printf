_PRINTF
====

**_printf**  prints formatted text

SYNOPSIS
========

| int _printf(const char *format, ...)

NAME
=====

Prints formatted text to the terminal. It prints different kinds of output
depending on a conversion specifier defined by the user.
This specifiers are defined by a % and a character:
c to print a character
s to print a string
% to print the % symbol
d to print a decimal
i to print an integer
It returns the number of characters printed.


RETURN VALUE
============
It returns an integer that represents the number of characters printed.

Example:

printf("%d", 7);

Output: 7
REturn: 1


This line of code would print the integer n; we know it is an integer because %d
is the conversion specifier for integers.
